# An Introduction to R  


Welcome to the GitHub repository for the TSL Intro to R training course. For this workshop you will be using the current version of R (`3.0.2`) along with the [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) integrated development environment (IDE). You will need to download these to your machine prior to this course. 


## Credits

This course is very heavily based on an excellent workshop given by Karthik Ram ([homepage](http://inundata.org/) ) at TGAC in September 2013 (accurately, I would say it's basically ripped off from that one). Immense kudos should go to Karthik for the work he has made available for any one to use (the original course is [here](https://github.com/ropensci/workshops-norwich-2013-09) ) and for inspiring me to give running an R course at TSL another go.
